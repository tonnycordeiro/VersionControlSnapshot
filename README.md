# VersionControlSnapshot
This library is used to make a machine snapshot, getting files and configurations mapped on system files, network and/or a database, and to check-in the generated files in a repository on TFS, to enable verifying changes by its version comparer feature, purposing fast recovering data and server status.

The project implements the design patterns _Strategy_ and _Factory Method_.
