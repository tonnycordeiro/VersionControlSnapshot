# VersionControlSnapshot
This library is used to make a machine snapshot, getting files and configurations mapped on system files, network and/or a database, and to check-in the generated files in a repository on TFS, to enable verifying changes by its version comparer feature, purposing fast recovering data and server status.

For further details and examples, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/tonnycordeiro/VersionControlSnapshot/wiki).
